        A LAN party is something special that can take a whole afternoon or a whole weekend. This depends on the time that the group may have. People may want to come here for quick troubleshooting or for some suggestions on what to play. Perhaps visitors will want to take a survey on what they have and what they want to play with their friends. This section will also go into how LAN games started and how it has evolved over time. Some influential games will be explored and how they affected the LAN play. There is a definite rise and fall of LAN gaming in the United States. At one point it was the dominant form of multiplayer gaming, but now it is a shadow of its former self. Even though the whole concept of a LAN party is greatly diminished, it is still a thing, and it is still alive. As of right now it is mainly a thing that friends do together to just have a great time.

      <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of issues that can come up while getting things set up for a good LAN party. Many games these days are online only, which means that they must be connected to an external server owned by a company for them to play a game. We will focus on games that do not require a connection to an outside server. There may be a connection to an in-house server instead. This can be as simple as a spare PC with the necessary software installed and connected to the network. This section will go into the nitty-gritty of running a LAN party. But these days it is usually easier than it was in the not-too-distant past. I remember going to a LAN party about ten years ago where it was literally plug and play, no configuring required. I have also been to a LAN party that fizzled out before it even began. It's also good to remember to have good food for people to eat.

      <h3>What to Play</h3>
      <p>
        What games can everyone play and what to do at the actual LAN party? This is a problem that has become more difficult to overcome as time marches forward. There are literally thousands of multiplayer games out there and many of them are not free. This section goes into what can be done to have everyone agree what to play during the LAN party. There will be a list of popular (and free!) multiplayer games that can get the ball rolling on decision making. It can suggest that everyone compiles a list of multiplayer games they would love to play, and everyone begins comparing notes. Games are selected and then research is done to determine what needs to be done to have an enjoyable experience. Will there be just one game? How about 5 games? No matter what there will need to be activities planned for things that do not involve sitting hunched over in front of the computer. Food and drinks need to be agreed upon, as well as who will bring what. You canâ€™t game on an empty stomach. What house rules will need to be followed? (Screen cheats, hacks, banned games/topics, etc.) This section will deal with a small LAN party between 3 to 10 friends over a weekend. Where will all the computers go? This answer really depends on how many people will be a part of the party. If it is just three friends, the living room can be a great place. 10 people can spread around the house or even be in the garage. There are also things to consider such as heat that can start to accumulate in the house.
