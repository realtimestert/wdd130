    <h1>Games to Play</h1>
    <p>        
        There are a lot of issues that can come up while getting things set up for a good LAN party. Many games these days are online only, which means that they must be connected to an external server owned by a company for them to play a game. We will focus on games that do not require a connection to an outside server. There may be a connection to an in-house server instead. This can be as simple as a spare PC with the necessary software installed and connected to the network. This section will go into the nitty-gritty of running a LAN party. But these days it is usually easier than it was in the not-too-distant past. I remember going to a LAN party about ten years ago where it was literally plug and play, no configuring required. I have also been to a LAN party that fizzled out before it even began. It's also good to remember to have good food for people to eat.

        What games can everyone play and what to do at the actual LAN party? This is a problem that has become more difficult to overcome as time marches forward. There are literally thousands of multiplayer games out there and many of them are not free. This section goes into what can be done to have everyone agree what to play during the LAN party. There will be a list of popular (and free!) multiplayer games that can get the ball rolling on decision making. It can suggest that everyone compiles a list of multiplayer games they would love to play, and everyone begins comparing notes. Games are selected and then research is done to determine what needs to be done to have an enjoyable experience. Will there be just one game? How about 5 games? No matter what there will need to be activities planned for things that do not involve sitting hunched over in front of the computer. Food and drinks need to be agreed upon, as well as who will bring what. You canâ€™t game on an empty stomach. What house rules will need to be followed? (Screen cheats, hacks, banned games/topics, etc.) This section will deal with a small LAN party between 3 to 10 friends over a weekend. Where will all the computers go? This answer really depends on how many people will be a part of the party. If it is just three friends, the living room can be a great place. 10 people can spread around the house or even be in the garage. There are also things to consider such as heat that can start to accumulate in the house.
