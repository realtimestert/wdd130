        A LAN party is something special that can take a whole afternoon or a whole weekend. This depends on the time that the group may have. People may want to come here for quick troubleshooting or for some suggestions on what to play. Perhaps visitors will want to take a survey on what they have and what they want to play with their friends. This section will also go into how LAN games started and how it has evolved over time. Some influential games will be explored and how they affected the LAN play. There is a definite rise and fall of LAN gaming in the United States. At one point it was the dominant form of multiplayer gaming, but now it is a shadow of its former self. Even though the whole concept of a LAN party is greatly diminished, it is still a thing, and it is still alive. As of right now it is mainly a thing that friends do together to just have a great time.
