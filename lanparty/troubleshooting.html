        There are a lot of issues that can come up while getting things set up for a good LAN party. Many games these days are online only, which means that they must be connected to an external server owned by a company for them to play a game. We will focus on games that do not require a connection to an outside server. There may be a connection to an in-house server instead. This can be as simple as a spare PC with the necessary software installed and connected to the network. This section will go into the nitty-gritty of running a LAN party. But these days it is usually easier than it was in the not-too-distant past. I remember going to a LAN party about ten years ago where it was literally plug and play, no configuring required. I have also been to a LAN party that fizzled out before it even began. It's also good to remember to have good food for people to eat.    </p>
