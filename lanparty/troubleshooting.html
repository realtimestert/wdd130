        There are a lot of issues that can come up while getting things set up for a good LAN party. Many games these days are online only, which means that they must be connected to an external server owned by a company for them to play a game. We will focus on games that do not require a connection to an outside server. There may be a connection to an in-house server instead. This can be as simple as a spare PC with the necessary software installed and connected to the network. This section will go into the nitty-gritty of running a LAN party. But these days it is usually easier than it was in the not-too-distant past. I remember going to a LAN party about ten years ago where it was literally plug and play, no configuring required. I have also been to a LAN party that fizzled out before it even began. It's also good to remember to have good food for people to eat.

    <p>Here are some questions to ask yourself when planning a LAN party.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What happens when a player is kicked out of a multi-hour game?</li>
        <li>Should there just be one game or many games to play?</li>
        <li>What time constraints are there? Or in other words, how long will it be?</li>
        <li>What should be done about the body odor situation?</li>
        <li>How hot are things going to get with all the people and hot computers in a small space?</li>
        <li>When should gaming time end? You need to remember that people need food and sleep.</li>
        <li>Remember to take breaks. Don't overdo it.</li>
        <li>What are you going to do when somebody is a sore loser/winner?</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, many people learned bad online etiquette while playing online games. People need to understand that at a close quarters party like this there needs to be an understanding of what to do when you win or lose. No bullying.</li>
        <li>Can you lose gracefully?</li>
    </ul>

        There is more to do than hoping everything will just plug and play without problems
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will this just be a party between friends and/or family?</li>
        <li>How much seating will there be?</li>
        <li>What will you do when more people than you expected showed up?</li>
        <li>Do you need a sign-up sheet to make sure that not too many people show up?</li>
        <li>Lots of computers will mean a greater power draw.</li>
        <li>Remember that some people will only be able to spend a little bit of money.</li>
        <li>That is why free games are always an option.</li>
        <li>You could also be generous and help them buy a cheap game that everyone is going to play, but be careful. Doing this too much can drain your wallet!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How many people will be there?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is one of the most important factors to consider when planning a LAN party. Get a solid number of people beforehand so you can start planning the rest of the party. Six people is a lot different than 30 people. All decisions are made on the number of people that will be present.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>What will be played?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Agree to the games you will all play at the LAN party long before you get things going for the party. Depending on time you may only have one game to play or there may be several. There may be a game that most people will want to play.</li>
      <li>I remember playing Halo 3 in high school with a large group of friends. There was 20 of us in one house spread out in the living room and upstairs. It was chaotic but fun.</li>
    </ul>
