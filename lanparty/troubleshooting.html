    <p>Here are some questions to ask yourself when planning a LAN party.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What happens when a player is kicked out of a multi-hour game?</li>
        <li>Should there just be one game or many games to play?</li>
        <li>What time constraints are there? Or in other words, how long will it be?</li>
        <li>What should be done about the body odor situation?</li>
        <li>How hot are things going to get with all the people and hot computers in a small space?</li>
        <li>When should gaming time end? You need to remember that people need food and sleep.</li>
        <li>Remember to take breaks. Don't overdo it.</li>
        <li>What are you going to do when somebody is a sore loser/winner?</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, many people learned bad online etiquette while playing online games. People need to understand that at a close quarters party like this there needs to be an understanding of what to do when you win or lose. No bullying.</li>
        <li>Can you lose gracefully?</li>
    </ul>
    <div id="food">
        <div id="food-box">
            <img id="food.img" src="images/food.jpg" alt="Don't forget about the Snacks">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        There is more to do than hoping everything will just plug and play without problems
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will this just be a party between friends and/or family?</li>
        <li>How much seating will there be?</li>
        <li>What will you do when more people than you expected showed up?</li>
        <li>Do you need a sign-up sheet to make sure that not too many people show up?</li>
        <li>Lots of computers will mean a greater power draw.</li>
        <li>Remember that some people will only be able to spend a little bit of money.</li>
        <li>That is why free games are always an option.</li>
        <li>You could also be generous and help them buy a cheap game that everyone is going to play, but be careful. Doing this too much can drain your wallet!</li>
    </ul>
